Denote $L$ be an $n \times n$ matrix as the Laplacecian matrix of graph $G$, where $L_{ii} = d_i, L_{ij} = #e(i,j)$.

- The number of spanning tree in $G$ is $\lvert \det(L^*) \rvert$, where $L^*$ is the $(n - 1) \times (n - 1)$ matrix by removing $r-th$ row and $r-th$ column in $L$.
- The number of spanning tree in directed graph in $G$ of root $r$ is similar by removing $r-th$ row and $r-th$ column in $L$.
